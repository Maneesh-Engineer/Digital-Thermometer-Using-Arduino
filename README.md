# Digital-Thermometer-Using-Arduino

Built a simple yet effective digital thermometer using an Arduino by Connect a temperature sensor (like LM35) to measure temperature and an LCD display to show the readings. The Arduino processes the sensor data, converts it into a readable format, and displays it on the LCD. 

This offered me a hands-on introduction to electronics and programming while creating a practical device.

Components:

1. Arduino board: Controls the system.
2. Temperature sensor (e.g., LM35): Converts temperature to voltage.
3. LCD display: Shows the measured temperature.
